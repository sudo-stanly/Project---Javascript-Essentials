// Q1 Use console.log to output your full name to the console.
console.log("Stanley Alerta");

// Q2 Output your year of birth.
console.log("2004");

// Q3 Try again to output your year of birth, this time passing the date without the quotes.
console.log(2004);

// Q4 We can pass several arguments to console.log separated by commas, e.g.:
console.log("abc", "def", "ghi", 1, 2, 3);

    // Output information about yourself to the console in the format: Name Surname (Year) e.g. Mary Stuart (1542).
    console.log("Stanley", "Alerta", "2004");

// Q5 Output the same information (name, surname, year) to the console, not side by side, but on consecutive lines.
console.log("Stanley");
console.log("Alerta");
console.log(2004);

// Q6  A string can be concatenated using the + sign, for example "abc" + "def" will be treated as "abcdef". Try writing your name, surname, and year of birth on one line again, this time not separated by commas, but by + signs.
console.log("Stanley"+"Alerta"+"2004");

// Question 7: Put spaces in the appropriate places, so that when displayed, you get the same effect as in Question 4.
console.log("Stanley "+"Alerta "+"2004");
