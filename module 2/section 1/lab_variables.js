/* 2.0.15 LAB Variables */

/*

Estimated time
15-30 minutes

Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

variables (i.e. naming, declaring, initializing and modifying their values)
Scenario
Our task will be to create a list of contacts. 
Initially, the list will be quite simple: we will only 
write three people to it using the data shown in the table below. 

In the rest of the course, you will return to this script and systematically 
extend it with new functionality, using the newly learned elements of JavaScript.


Declare and initialize the variables where you 
will store all the information (nine variables in total). 
Display in the console information about the first and last 
contact in the form: name/phone/email.
